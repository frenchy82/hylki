# Installing

The short version is in the [README](../README.md#installing); this page has
the rest.

## Flatpak (recommended)

Works on any distribution, on **x86_64 and aarch64 (ARM64)**. Installing from
the signed repo picks the right architecture on its own and keeps the app
updated:

```sh
flatpak install --user --from https://hylki.hyprlab.co/flatpak/co.hyprlab.Hylki.flatpakref
```

**Prefer a direct download?** Each release carries `Hylki-x86_64.flatpak` and
`Hylki-aarch64.flatpak`; grab the one matching `uname -m` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/hyprlab/hylki/releases/latest) and run
`flatpak install --user ./Hylki-*.flatpak`. The bundle carries the repo address
and signing key, so it still receives updates from the official repo. (A bundle
holds a single architecture; the repo above holds both.)

**Bazaar** does not install from a `.flatpakref` whose repository it does not
already know: it reads only the app's ID from the file and reports "ID
'co.hyprlab.Hylki' was not found". Add the repository once, and Hylki then
shows up in Bazaar's search:

```sh
flatpak remote-add --user --if-not-exists hylki https://hylki.hyprlab.co/flatpak/co.hyprlab.Hylki.flatpakrepo
```

## Fedora

Add the signed dnf repository on hylki.hyprlab.co and install from it. Hylki
then updates with the rest of the system, through GNOME Software or
`dnf upgrade`:

```sh
sudo curl -fsSLo /etc/yum.repos.d/hylki.repo https://hylki.hyprlab.co/rpm/hylki.repo
sudo dnf install hylki
```

dnf asks once to trust the repository's signing key, fingerprint
`91A0 AC23 CFD8 C720 4417 B899 8E9F 3DC1 7CFF B221` (the Flatpak repository's
key).

The `.rpm` is also attached to each
[release](https://github.com/hyprlab/hylki/releases/latest). From 1.43.0 the
package adds the repository itself, so an RPM installed from a download
keeps updating too; it is the same `/etc/yum.repos.d/hylki.repo`, kept if you
edit it (set `enabled=0` to stop updates from it).

The RPM targets current Fedora releases (44+) on x86_64 only. On ARM, or on
anything older, use the Flatpak or [build from source](BUILDING.md).

## Gentoo

A community-maintained ebuild lives in
[bennypowers' overlay](https://github.com/bennypowers/gentoo-overlay)
(thanks [@bennypowers](https://github.com/bennypowers)):

```sh
eselect repository enable bennypowers
emaint sync -r bennypowers
emerge -av mail-client/hylki
```

## Nix

A community-maintained flake lives in
[tbaumann's fork](https://github.com/tbaumann/hylki) (thanks
[@tbaumann](https://github.com/tbaumann)):

```sh
nix run github:tbaumann/hylki
```

## Beta channel

Flatpak betas install alongside the stable app as a separate application
(`co.hyprlab.Hylki.Beta`), with their own settings and cache. See
[hylki.hyprlab.co](https://hylki.hyprlab.co) for the repo address.

On Fedora, betas also come as RPMs from a beta dnf repository. They replace the
installed `hylki` package rather than sitting beside it, and share its settings.
Every RPM from 1.43.0 carries the beta repository, switched off; turn it on
once:

```sh
sudo dnf config-manager setopt hylki-beta.enabled=1
sudo dnf upgrade --refresh hylki
```

A beta version such as `1.44.0~beta.1` sorts before `1.44.0`, so the stable
release replaces the last beta when it comes out, and the next beta follows it.
To leave the betas, set `hylki-beta.enabled=0`; dnf won't move back to an older
version by itself, so run `sudo dnf distro-sync hylki` to return to the
newest stable. With an RPM older than 1.43.0, add the beta repository with
`sudo curl -fsSLo /etc/yum.repos.d/hylki-beta.repo https://hylki.hyprlab.co/rpm/hylki-beta.repo`.

## Other distributions

Arch, Debian/Ubuntu and Snap packages were discontinued after 1.7.0. Use the
Flatpak (it works on every distribution) or [build from source](BUILDING.md).

## Runtime requirements

A Secret Service provider (e.g. gnome-keyring, preinstalled on GNOME) is needed
for password storage. Everything else the Flatpak carries; a source or RPM
install also wants `gnupg2` for [OpenPGP](DOCUMENTATION.md#openpgp-encrypted-and-signed-mail)
and `nautilus-python` for the
[Files entry](DOCUMENTATION.md#send-with-hylki-from-gnome-files).
